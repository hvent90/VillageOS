# Village Delete Command Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement a delete command for villages that allows server administrators to permanently remove villages with proper confirmation and cascade cleanup. This addresses the need for village lifecycle management in the collaborative farming simulator.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation
- **VillageRepository**: Has create, read, update operations but no delete method
- **CommandProcessorService**: Handles village subcommands (create, show, plant, water, build) but no delete handler
- **Database Schema**: Proper cascade deletes configured:
  - `VillageMember` ‚Üí `Village` (onDelete: Cascade)
  - `VillageObject` ‚Üí `Village` (onDelete: Cascade)
- **Permissions**: No current permission system - anyone can create villages
- **Commands**: Slash commands defined in `src/config/slashCommands.ts`

### Key Findings
- Database relationships will automatically clean up village members and objects on deletion
- No village ownership tracking currently exists
- Command routing uses subcommand pattern in `handleCreateCommand`, `handleShowCommand`, etc.
- Discord integration uses deferred replies for async operations

## Desired End State

After implementation:
- Server administrators can delete villages using `/village delete <village_name>`
- Command requires explicit confirmation to prevent accidental deletion
- All village data (members, objects) is properly cleaned up via cascade deletes
- Clear success/error messages guide user through the process
- Proper logging for audit trail

### Key Verification Points
- [ ] Delete command appears in Discord slash command list
- [ ] Only server administrators can execute delete command
- [ ] Confirmation prompt prevents accidental deletion
- [ ] Village and all related data removed from database
- [ ] User receives clear success/error feedback

## What We're NOT Doing

- Adding village ownership tracking (out of scope for this implementation)
- Implementing soft deletes (hard delete with cascade cleanup)
- Adding bulk delete operations
- Implementing undo functionality
- Adding user-level permissions beyond Discord admin role

## Implementation Approach

### Permission Model
Use Discord's built-in administrator permissions rather than implementing custom ownership tracking. This leverages existing Discord role management and is consistent with server administration patterns.

### Confirmation Flow
Two-step confirmation process:
1. Initial command shows warning with village details
2. User must provide explicit confirmation to proceed

### Error Handling
- Validate village exists before attempting deletion
- Check user permissions before processing
- Provide clear error messages for all failure scenarios
- Log all delete operations for audit purposes

## Phase 1: Database Layer Implementation

### Overview
Add delete method to VillageRepository with proper error handling and logging.

### Changes Required

#### 1. VillageRepository (`src/repositories/villageRepository.ts`)
**File**: `src/repositories/villageRepository.ts`
**Changes**: Add `deleteVillage` method with validation and logging

```typescript
async deleteVillage(villageId: string): Promise<void> {
  // Verify village exists before deletion
  const village = await this.prisma.village.findUnique({
    where: { id: villageId }
  });

  if (!village) {
    throw new Error('Village not found');
  }

  // Delete village (cascade will handle members and objects)
  await this.prisma.village.delete({
    where: { id: villageId }
  });
}
```

### Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `npm run build`
- [ ] Unit tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Linting passes: `npm run lint`

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] Method appears in VillageRepository class
- [ ] Method throws appropriate error for non-existent villages
- [ ] Database constraints properly validated

---

## Phase 2: Command Processing Logic

### Overview
Add delete command handler to CommandProcessorService with permission checks and confirmation flow.

### Changes Required

#### 1. Command Types (`src/types/commandResults.ts`)
**File**: `src/types/commandResults.ts`
**Changes**: Add DELETE to CommandName enum

```typescript
export enum CommandName {
  PLANT = 'plant',
  WATER = 'water',
  BUILD = 'build',
  SHOW = 'show',
  PING = 'ping',
  ME = 'me',
  DELETE = 'delete'  // Add this line
}
```

#### 2. Command Processor (`src/services/commandProcessorService.ts`)
**File**: `src/services/commandProcessorService.ts`
**Changes**: Add delete subcommand routing and handler method

```typescript
// In routeCommand method, add:
case 'delete':
  return await this.handleDeleteCommand(command);

// Add new method:
private async handleDeleteCommand(command: CommandInput): Promise<CommandResult> {
  // Permission check logic here
  // Confirmation flow logic here
  // Village deletion logic here
}
```

### Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `npm run build`
- [ ] Command routing includes delete subcommand
- [ ] Handler method exists with proper signature

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] DELETE added to CommandName enum
- [ ] Command processor routes delete subcommand correctly
- [ ] Handler method stub implemented

---

## Phase 3: Discord Integration

### Overview
Add delete subcommand to slash commands and implement Discord permission checks.

### Changes Required

#### 1. Slash Commands (`src/config/slashCommands.ts`)
**File**: `src/config/slashCommands.ts`
**Changes**: Add delete subcommand to village command

```typescript
.addSubcommand(subcommand =>
  subcommand
    .setName('delete')
    .setDescription('üóëÔ∏è Delete village (Admin only)')
    .addStringOption(option =>
      option.setName('confirmation')
        .setDescription('Type "DELETE" to confirm village deletion')
        .setRequired(true)
        .setMinLength(6)
        .setMaxLength(6)
    )
)
```

#### 2. Discord Bot Service (`src/services/discordBotService.ts`)
**File**: `src/services/discordBotService.ts`
**Changes**: Add permission check for delete command

```typescript
// In handleSlashCommand method, add permission check for delete
if (interaction.options.getSubcommand() === 'delete') {
  if (!interaction.memberPermissions?.has('Administrator')) {
    await interaction.editReply('‚ùå Only server administrators can delete villages.');
    return;
  }
}
```

### Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification
- [ ] Slash commands register successfully: `npm run build`
- [ ] Discord bot service includes permission check

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] Delete subcommand appears in Discord command list
- [ ] Permission check blocks non-admin users
- [ ] Confirmation parameter properly extracted

---

## Phase 4: Complete Delete Logic Implementation

### Overview
Implement the full delete command logic with validation, confirmation, and cleanup.

### Changes Required

#### 1. Command Processor - Delete Handler (`src/services/commandProcessorService.ts`)
**File**: `src/services/commandProcessorService.ts`
**Changes**: Implement complete delete logic

```typescript
private async handleDeleteCommand(command: CommandInput): Promise<CommandResult> {
  if (!this.villageRepository) {
    return {
      success: false,
      error: { type: 'INTERNAL', message: 'Village service unavailable' }
    };
  }

  try {
    // Find village by server ID
    const village = await this.villageRepository.findByGuildId(command.serverId);
    if (!village) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: { type: 'VALIDATION', message: 'No village found for this server' }
      };
    }

    // Check confirmation
    const confirmation = command.args?.confirmation;
    if (confirmation !== 'DELETE') {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: {
          type: 'VALIDATION',
          message: '‚ùå Please type "DELETE" exactly to confirm village deletion'
        }
      };
    }

    // Delete village (cascade handles cleanup)
    await this.villageRepository.deleteVillage(village.id);

    return {
      success: true,
      message: `üóëÔ∏è Village "${village.name || 'Unnamed'}" has been permanently deleted. All members and objects have been removed.`
    };

  } catch (error) {
    logger.error({
      event: 'village_delete_error',
      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
      serverId: command.serverId
    });

    return {
      success: false,
      error: { type: 'INTERNAL', message: 'Failed to delete village' }
    };
  }
}
```

### Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `npm run build`
- [ ] Unit tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Integration tests pass: `npm run test:integration`

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] Delete command works end-to-end in Discord
- [ ] Confirmation validation prevents accidental deletion
- [ ] Village data properly removed from database
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test VillageRepository.deleteVillage method
- Test permission validation logic
- Test confirmation validation
- Test error scenarios (village not found, service unavailable)

### Integration Tests
- Test full command flow from Discord interaction to database
- Test cascade delete behavior
- Test permission enforcement

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create a test village as admin
2. Attempt delete without confirmation (should fail)
3. Attempt delete with wrong confirmation text (should fail)
4. Attempt delete as non-admin user (should fail)
5. Successfully delete village with proper confirmation
6. Verify village and related data removed from database
7. Verify other server villages unaffected

## Performance Considerations

- Delete operation is database-heavy due to cascade deletes
- Consider adding database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Monitor database performance during large village deletions
- Implement proper transaction handling for data consistency

## Migration Notes

- No database schema changes required (using existing cascade deletes)
- Existing villages remain unaffected
- New permission checks only apply to delete command
- Backward compatibility maintained for all other village operations
